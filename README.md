# philosophers

For this project, we must learn about concurrent programming. 

For the project's mandatory part, we must find a solution to the problem using only threads and mutexes. 

For the bonus part, we must create a second program that uses processes and semaphores.
 
Each philosopher is a thread and each fork is protected by a mutex. 

There is exactly one fork between each philosopher and a philosopher must take the forks 

to his immediate left and right in order to eat.
